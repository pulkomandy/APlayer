<H3>Loading</H3>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><B>Double buffering:</B><BR>APlayer loads next module in the list when the actual module is playing. Early load tells APlayer how far (positions) from the ending of the current module APlayer will start loading the next one. Enabling this feature will make the small pause between modules very short. It can be used if you e.g. play a MP3 album where each song is merged into each other.</TD></TR>

<IMG SRC="pictures/settings3.png"><P>
<H3>General</H3>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD><B>Mixer frequency:</B><BR>Allows you to change the output-quality of the played sound. The quality ranges from 8268 to 48000 hertz. Note that this won't affect APlayer until the next song is played.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Stereo separation:</B><BR>100% is total stereo separation ie. left is left and rigth is right. 0% is mono, which forces APlayer to play all sounds in both channels. This can be useful for listening to modules in headphones, where a stereo-separation of 50% will make them sound much better.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Interpolation:</B><BR>Helps the sound to be less "rough" and make lesser clicks'n'pops. This pretty much resembles the effect of the filter on the Amiga. Interpolation consumes about 25% more cpu-power than usual.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Dolby Prologic surround:</B><BR>Only supported by a few trackers (ImpulseTracker) and is rarely used. If you want APlayer to reckon this and make a difference between the front and rear speakers, enable this function. Ofcourse this requires a Dolby Prologic amplifier connected to your computer. Module called "Rippless.it" uses surround with the speech sample, so it can be used for testing purposes.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Emulate Amiga led filter:</B><BR>Sets on Amiga led filter emulation which is basically a low bass filter. Only few mod trackers support this feature.</TD></TR>

<H3>Channels</H3>
<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD>Most [read: all] modules uses more than one channel, and sometimes you would want to disable certain channels (e.g. the annoying hihat in channel xx). You have the choice between finding the given channel by trying every button one after one, or you can use the buttons to the left which change the state of all the given channels. Try it out!</TD></TR>

This delay is caused by a bug in Tracker and APlayer can't do anything about it.</TD></TR>

<TABLE BORDER="0">
<TR><TD>The players, agents and clients are considered as add-ons, hence this common description of their setting-windows. To the left you can see a list of the available add-ons with their name and version. If add-on name is in blue color it means that it is in use and is used 
when playing modules, so it is easy to see which player and output agent is used to play that module. Just like in the tracker, columns can be sorted and moved around as you like. To the right the description of the currently selected add-on is shown.<P>
To disable (prevent it from being loaded) you can double-click any add-on.<P>
Some players/agents/clients have special <A HREF="playersettings.html">settings</A> (e.g. the SID-player) and to set those you select the add-on and press Settings.<P>
Some add-ons have something to display while the music is being played and it can showed by using the Display button.</TR></TD>
