How to compile
==============

It's very easy to compile the APlayer sources.

1. Open a Terminal window and change the directory to <where APlayer sources are stored>/APlayer_4/Master
2. Type make and press enter. This will start the compiler which will compile all projects in APlayer.

If you compile one of the beta versions of APlayer, the compiled files will be very huge on x86, That's because they contain debugger information.

You should now have a full build in the bin directory. Try to run APlayer. It's stored in the APlayer/bin/BeOS_??? directory.
