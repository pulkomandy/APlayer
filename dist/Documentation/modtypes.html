This is a list of the module types APlayer can play. The list contains all module types, not only the different players. This is the way I count the number of supported module types APlayer can play.<P>
For each module type there is information about how module type is handled. If info tells: Played (Player name), it means that APlayer uses &quot;Player name&quot; player to handle it. On the other hand some modules have info like: Converted (Converter). This means that APlayer uses &quot;Converter&quot; to convert module to another format which APlayer can play. This way an add-on can convert several kinds of exotic modules into one common format, playable by APlayer. On the other hand, some of the players (e.g. ModTracker) can by itself play more than one module format, like pro/noise/star-tracker.

    This is a module format where the module uses C64 like synth
    sounds. It come from the Amiga, where it was known as the THX
    format, but the programmers changed the name to AHX.  Reason for this change was legal problems with the THX name and George Lucas sound system. The editor was created by Pink and Dexter of Abyss. The player we use is
    created by Bartman of Abyss.<P><B>Mime Type:</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;audio/x-ahx<P><B>File Extension(s):</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;.ahx .thx<P><B>Played (AHX):</B><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;AHX 1.x<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;AHX 2.x</TD>

    Previously this music format has been known as &quot;Fredmon&quot; or &quot;Fred
    Monitor&quot; which is wrong. The right name is &quot;Fred Editor&quot;. There
    are 2 types of modules, which are editor and final. APlayer can
    play both types. The editor files can be loaded into the Fred
    Editor program. The final modules have a 68000 assembler player
    in the beginning of the file and can't be loaded into the editor. There are some good C64 covers available made by Jogeir Liljedahl.

	Mod file format is the main file format used on the Amiga. A lot of demos, even games used this format 
	and has been improved over the years with more effects and samples. A lot of demo groups have created they own format based on the mod
	format, which packed the file to a minimum. These file can be converted back to the original mod format and played by APlayer.<P>
    
    Mod file format supports a wide range of ProTracker like formats including: ProTracker,
    FastTracker, TakeTracker, SoundTracker15, SoundTracker31, NoiseTracker
    &amp; StarTrekker with AM support.

    Do you remember the music from Turican II or Rock'n'Roll on the
    Amiga? Well, it was Chris H&uuml;lsbeck who composed these wonderful
    pieces of music and you can now play them with APlayer. You can
    download tons of music by Chris on the internet in this format.
    There is 3 formats this player can play, and that's the old 1.5
    format, the Professional and the 7-Voices formats.<P>
    The player is based on Jonathan H. Pickard player routine on Linux.
    7-voices player is created by both Chris and Jochen Hippel, because Jochen had written a great
    mixer routine on the Amiga. Later on, a tool was created on the Amiga to 
    merge the two files TFMX have (the .mdat and .smpl files) together in one 
    file. APlayer can also play these standalone files.
