<UL>
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a lot of small and big bugs.
  <LI>Mixer routine <B>fixed</B> so it works with MixTest (thanks
  Marco Nelissen)
  <LI><B>Added</B> module information window
  <LI><B>Added</B> new players: SoundTracker15, SoundTracker31,
  NoiseTracker, ProTracker, StarTrekker with AM support, FastTracker,
  TakeTracker and MultiTracker.
  <LI>Now remembers the window-positions and sizes.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the about window.
</UL>

<A NAME="302"></A>
<H3>Version 3.0.2 Released 22. February 1998</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Module List Editor add-on.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the menus a little bit and added online help.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the mixer routine. It didn't move the
  sample pointer when a sample was played with volume 0.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the mime-type strings in the players to correct
  mime strings. Thanks goes to Rainer Ried for telling me.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> Had reversed the left and right channels in
  the mixer (oops :)
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a lot of small and big bugs.
</UL>

<A NAME="310"></A>
<H3>Version 3.1.0 Released 6. July 1998</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Added</B> subsong interface.
  <LI><B>Added</B> C64 player (Based on SidPlay by Michael Schwendt).
  <LI><B>Bug fixed</B> in the ModTracker player. If loop start
  was different from 0, it <BR>
  says the sample is looping, even if loop length is 1 or lower.
  <LI>If the user press in the main window listview where there
  isn't any items, it <BR>
  unselects the current playing item. <B>Fixed</B>.
  <LI>The quit procedure rewritten a little bit. It didn't work
  under Release 3 of <BR>
  BeOS. Thanks to Peter Potrebic from Be for discovering <B>the
  bug</B>.
  <LI>Didn't free the playing module when a new APML list was loaded.
  <LI>Some ProTracker modules do some funny tricks, like playing
  a pattern <BR>
  backwards. This result APlayer to skip the module and go on with
  the next. Now <BR>
  the player checks to see if the pattern is played backwards and
  then it won't <BR>
  jump to the next module.
  <LI>The config load and save functions are endianess aware, which
  means you can <BR>
  take a config file from PPC and use it on an INTEL machine and
  vice versa.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the About window again :) This time the scroll
  routine is totally <BR>
  rewritten, added a nice logo and added some more information.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the application mime string to application/x-vnd.Polycode.APlayer.
<BR>
  Remember to remove the old mime string from the FileType preference
  program, or <BR>
  to make really sure, remove the file called: <BR>
  /boot\home/config/settings/beos_mime/application/x-vnd.APlayer.
  <LI>The StarTrekker player doesn't require the .nt file anymore.
  If the module <BR>
  use AM voices and the .nt file isn't there, silence will appear
  to your ear :)
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the way APlayer launches the online-help.
  Now it asks for the default <BR>
  browser and start this instead of using NetPositive directly
  + it checks to see <BR>
  if the document exists before it launches it.
  <LI>The behavour when you drag a module into the main window
  has changed. Now it <BR>
  frees the playing module and clears the list before it add the
  dropped modules.
  <LI>When you save an APML file, the mimetype on the file will
  be set to <BR>
  &quot;text/plain&quot;.
  <LI>Now APlayer remember which windows was open with last exit
  and open the <BR>
  windows again when started next time.
  <LI><B>Added</B> add-on config interface.
</UL>

<A NAME="320"></A>
<H3>Version 3.2.0 Released 17. August 1998</H3>
<UL>

  functions.
  <LI>The loader doesn't crash anymore when you try to load a file
  which doesn't <BR>
  exists.
  <LI>Converter interface <B>added</B>.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the MikMod player + improved and fixed some
  bugs in it :), eg. can it <BR>
  play the Essential.s3m module right. Can now play:<BR>
<BR>
  <B>669</B> - Improved a lot. It almost a new converter. The slide
<BR>
  effects works now. Some small effects is not supported yet.<BR>
  <B>Farandole</B> - Almost totally rewritten the MikMod converter.
  There <BR>
  was a lot of bugs in it and added some extra effect support.<BR>
  <B>FastTracker II<BR>
  ImpulseTracker<BR>
  ScreamTracker 2.xx<BR>
  ScreamTracker 3.xx<BR>
  UltraTracker</B> - Fixed some small bugs + fixed the sample offset
<BR>
  effect to handle 0x99 offsets. Only 95% supported.
  <LI>Now players can tell APlayer how many channels the module
  use and how many <BR>
  to reserve. This is used in ImpulseTracker because of the New
  Note Action.
  <LI><B>New version</B> of the SidPlay player.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the about window again a little bit. Now the
  logo is placed in the <BR>
  window to begin with and starts scrolling out.
</UL>

<A NAME="330"></A>
<H3>Version 3.3.0 Released 6. January 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the NotePlayer interface so it uses a class
  instead of a structure to tell APlayer what to play.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a little bug in the SID settings slider DrawText()
  function.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the whole add-on interface. Rewritten from
  scratch. It's now more OO-like. Boy, this took a long time to
  do. All the players are rewritten to use the new interface.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> so all the windows are opened at the same
  time when starting APlayer.
  <LI><B>Upgraded</B> the ColumnListView from &quot;Santa's gift
  bag&quot; to version 2.3.
  <LI><B>Added</B> Dolby Surround support in the mixer.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the new version of the MikMod player (3.1.2).
  I have integrated the bug fixes and features from the new version

  <B>669</B> - It now plays with the current speed.<BR>
  <B>FAR</B> - Improved a little bit.<BR>
  <B>IT</B> - Support for packed samples + optimized a little bit.<BR>
  <B>S3M - </B>with more than 16 channels (i.e not created with
  Scream Tracker) caused<BR>
  previous version to crash + it can recognice Imago Orpheus types.<BR>

<A NAME="335"></A>
<H3>Version 3.3.5 Released 20. March 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Using</B> my new PolyKit library. That means some of my
  classes are removed from the APlayerClasses library to the PolyKit
  library.
  <LI>Bug <B>fixed</B>. Can now play modules directly from read-only
  drives again, such as CD-ROM drives.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Future Composer 1.4 player.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the ModuleConverter agent, which is able to
  convert Future Composer 1.0-1.3 to Future Composer 1.4.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> memory leaks in all the players when something
  goes wrong while loading the module.
  <LI><B>Thread safed</B> the SetPosition() in all the players.
  <LI><B>Updated</B> the ColumnListView to version 2.6.
  <LI><B>Added</B> a new position slider in the main window.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the mixer routine. Samples longer than 1
  Mb were not played correctly. The mixer routine now uses 64 bit
  integers to hold some intern calculations when needed. It still
  uses 32 bit integers when mixing small samples.
  <LI><B>Bug</B> fixed. Samples with ping-pong loops could make
  APlayer to crash on some rare conditions.
  <LI><B>Updated</B> the MikMod player to 3.1.5 and that includes:<BR>
<BR>
  Loaders:<BR>
<BR>
  <B>AMF</B> modules in formats 1.0, 1.2 and 1.3 couldn't be loaded.<BR>
  <B>S3M</B> loader correctly identifies S3M modules created by
  ImpulseTracker and Imago Orpheus.<BR>
  <B>STM</B> loader rejected STM created by MOD2STM; the last pattern
  was never played; also in some STM modules the samples were not
  loaded correctly.<BR>
  <B>XM </B>modules in format 1.02 couldn't be loaded.<BR>
  <B>Added</B> the STX (STMIK 0.2), IMF (Imago Orpheus) and GDM

  <B>Added</B> the UNI loader, for those who need to play the 'Acid
  Tetris' or 'Axia' songs.<BR>
<BR>
  Player:<BR>
<BR>
  Envelope sustain loops in XM modules were not processed correctly.<BR>
  Porta to note using the command memory used sometimes an incorrect
  value when playing AMF, IT, S3M and ULT modules.<BR>
  Volume slides for IT (Dxx) and XM (Axx) modules didn't continue
  in the background.<BR>
  Porta down effect in the volume column of IT modules was not
  played correctly.<BR>
  IT effect T (slide tempo) is now implemented.

<A NAME="340"></A>
<H3>Version 3.4.0 Released 12. July 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>A Volume <B>bug</B> has been <B>removed </B>from the MikMod
  player.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>an IT loader bug in the MikMod converter. It
  can now play the &quot;Revenge of the Cats&quot; module. Thanks
  to David Terrell for reporting this.
  <LI><B>Cleaned up </B>the Global data area and created the APModuleList
  class.
  <LI>Now supports CL-Amp and SoundPlay playlists.
  <LI>When you save an APML (APlayer Module List), it will set
  the mime-type to text/x-aplayer-list.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>some bugs in the ModTracker player. It can now
  play modules which have backwards pattern correct. Thanks to
  Cedric Degea for reporting this bug.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>another bug in the ModTracker player. Some Jogeir
  Liljedahl modules sounded terrible out-of-tune. The reason to
  this is that the player thought it was NoiseTracker modules and
  then disabled finetune. The volume-bug Cedric Degea reported
  to me is also fixed by this.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the Future Composer 1.0-1.3 converter.
  Some modules played out of tune.
  <LI>If a player changes one of the values displayed in the module
  information window, the Module Info Agent will now check to see
  if the update differs from the current data, otherwise it won't
  update it. This will save some CPU cycles and flickering :)
  <LI><B>Improved </B>the drawing code for the columns in the Module
  Info agent.
  <LI>If the Players and/or Agents directory doesn't exists, APlayer
  crashed when started.
  <LI>Improved the Module List Editor startup time and reduced
  the amount of memory used when using the file panels. Now they
  won't be allocated until they are needed and freed again when
  the module list editor window is closed.
  <LI><B>Rewritten </B>the loader routine. It should now be more
  safe and shouldn't crash like the old one did in some rare cases.
  <LI>Made some <B>changes </B>in the player interface. If you
  are programming a player, you need to change it a little bit.
  See the APlayer Developer Kit for more information.
  <LI>The module information window will now show the filename
  if the returned module name from the player is empty or only
  have spaces.
  <LI>The surround panning flag didn't work in sample players.
  <LI>Added a <B>new </B>version of SidPlay so it now uses version
  1.36.35.
  <LI>Added the settings window. Phew, that was a lot of work :)
  <LI>Optimized the module list editor listcode a lot on large
  lists. Now it only takes a few seconds to load a list with 1600
  modules. The clear list function isn't optimized yet, because
  of a bug in BeOS that make APlayer crash (the MakeEmpty() on
  BListView doesn't work right).
  <LI>Very long samples <B>were </B>truncated in the mixer.
  <LI><B>Added </B>a beta version of the OctaMed player. A big
  thanks to Cedric Degea for making this player.
  <LI><B>Added </B>the MPG123 player, created by Claes L&ouml;fqvist.
  A big thanks to him too.<BR>
  <LI><B>Updated</B> the MikMod player to 3.1.7 and that includes:<BR>
<BR>
  Loaders:<BR>
<BR>
  Delay note effect was incorrectly converted to pattern jump,
  and porta to note was incorrectly converted to tremor, for GDM
  modules.<BR>
  Dual effect Lxx in S3M and IT was misconverted to L00.<BR>
  XM modules in format 1.03 couldn't be loaded.<BR>
<BR>
  Player:<BR>
<BR>
  Invalid notes using non-existent instruments caused the current
  note to be retriggered instread of being ignored.<BR>
  Porta to note effects did not restart the sample envelopes.<BR>
  Note cut with non empty volume column on the same row resulted
  in the note cut being ignored.<BR>
  Disabling/enabling envelopes had no effect.<BR>
  Pitch envelope was not played accurately (IT)<BR>
  Set finetune effect (E5x) wasn't handled correctly for XM modules.<BR>
  Fine slides (X1x, X2x) didn't play correctly for XM modules.
</UL>

<A NAME="342"></A>
<H3>Version 3.4.2 Released 10. August 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a lot of bugs in the MPEG player (previously
  released in 3.4.1 patch)
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>a bug in the OpenExtraFile() function. It didn't
  use the directory when checking for prefixes.
  <LI>When playing a module, the music stopped when you change
  the position. Bug introduced in 3.4.1 and is now <B>fixed</B>.
  <LI>When a genre code in a mpeg file is -1 (none), the MPEG player
  crashed. <B>Fixed</B>.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the AHX player. A big thanks to Bernhard Wodok
  (Bartman of Abyss) for sending us the source to his player.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the GetMixingFrequency() function in the APAddOnPlayer
  class.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a little bug in the MikMod S3M loader.
</UL>

<A NAME="350"></A>
<H3>Version 3.5.0 Released 8. November 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a small bug in the AHX player. SidVibes.ahx
  now plays without any problems.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the player interface a little bit. Hertz is
  now used instead of BPM, when a player reports the speed of a
  module to APlayer. With this method, the speed can be defined
  with a significantly better precision.
  <LI>If you loop an MP3 file, the music chopped everytime it looped.
  Thanks to Arild Fischer for reporting this.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the sample info window agent. You can now see
  all the samples, play them on the keyboard and save your favorite
  sounds.
  <LI><B>Added</B> author finding system. Searches through the
  sample/instrument names to find an author.
  <LI><B>Updated</B> the column list view to version 2.85.
  <LI><B>Rewrote</B> the internal interface to the mixers &amp;
  added support for virtual mixers in agents.
  <LI>When playing a MP3 file with a different frequency than the
  mixing frequency, the file sounded choppy.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the void* pointers to const void* pointers
  in the APChannel class.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the window position save routines.
  If you placed a window so it got a negative value in either x
  or y, the next time APlayer started, it would try to open the
  window using a very big value. Thanks to Cedric Degea for telling
  me.
  <LI>If you paused an MP3 at position 99, APlayer took all the
  CPU power it could get.
  <LI>Now APlayer only allocates the reverb buffers when needed.
  This means, APlayer will allocate or free the memory on the fly.
  <LI><B>Upgraded</B> the MikMod player and converter to 3.1.8.<BR>
<BR>
  IT global volume slide effect was played too fast.<BR>
  IT effect S6x (pattern delay for x ticks) was misunderstood as
  SEx (pattern delay for x rows).<BR>
  Finetune effect was not handled correctly for some XM modules.<BR>
  AMF effect 4 and variants leaked memory.<BR>
  IT modules featuring patterns with less than 32 rows could not
  be loaded.<BR>
  Some samples and effects in modules converted by APlayer (.apun)
  were not played correctly.<BR>
  Linefeeds in the song message in IT modules weren't loaded correctly.<BR>
  IMF effect XE (ignore envelope) implemented.<BR>
  More 'slightly corrupted' XM modules can be loaded.
</UL>

<A NAME="351"></A>
<H3>Version 3.5.1 Released 20. December 1999</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>If you disabled the Sample Info agent while playing a module,
  APlayer crashed. This is <B>fixed</B> now.
  <LI>If you played a MP3 with variable bit-rate and you manually
  begin to play a SID, the &quot;Init Addr&quot; in the module
  info window will show the last bit-rate from the MP3. <B>Fixed</B>
  now.
  <LI><B>Changed</B>, so it's only every 10th bit-rate change that
  is updated in the module info window, when playing variable bit-rate
  MP3s. This is done to save some CPU time.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the path requesters in the paths settings,
  so the start in the parent directory instead of the current.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the &quot;add file&quot; path requester open
  button in the module list editor to &quot;add&quot;.
  <LI>APlayer can now load WinAmp list files + it can load all
  list types with no path given in the lists.
  <LI><B>Updated</B> the column list view to version 2.93 (from
  Santa's Gift Bag).
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the module list add functions in both the
  main window and the module list editor (it's twice as fast now).
  <LI>If a player couldn't be initialized on the specific module,
  the module will now be removed from the list and the next module
  will be loaded.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the <I>LockListWithTimeout()</I> to the APModuleList
  class.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the &quot;Remember module list when exit&quot;
  option in the settings window.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> a deadlock when the user selects a module
  in the modulelist and keep the mouse button down. If the current
  playing module then ends, a deadlock occure. Thanks to Cedric
  Degea for reporting this.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the TFMX player.
  <LI><B>Boosted</B> the finally volume in the mixer.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the speed when stopping and changing position
  in a sample player like the Mpeg player.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Sample player + added a loader to the AudioIFF
  converter.
</UL>

<A NAME="352"></A>
<H3>Version 3.5.2 Released 16. February 2000</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>If you opened the settings window, pressed the cancel button
  and then opened the SID settings window via the menu, APlayer
  said that the window couldn't be initialized. The reason is that
  the main settings window removed some backup keys from APlayers
  registry that shouldn't be removed. <B>Fixed</B> now.
  <LI>From 3.5.1, you couldn't play the samples on the keyboard
  when the module was paused. <B>Fixed</B> now.
  <LI><B>Added</B> SoundFX 2.0 player and added the SoundFX 1.3
  converter in the ModuleConverter agent.
  <LI>If you selected one of the players or agents in the settings
  window with the mouse, you couldn't move the selection bar with
  the cursor keys. <B>Fixed</B> now.
  <LI>The sample info window ignored the save format changes you
  made. It just saved in the same format all the time.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the converter interface.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the RIFF-WAVE converter, so you can now save
  samples in .wav format + play .wav files.
  <LI>Agents can now plug-in with priorities, by using the GetPluginPriority()
  function in APAddOnAgent.
  <LI><B>Renamed</B> all the AfterLoadingBeforeCheck constants
  and functions to just BeforeCheck, because the players load the
  module by themself (old change), so the AfterLoading part is
  misleading.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a deadlock that sometimes could occur when using
  the &quot;Remember module list&quot; option. APlayer deadlocked
  when you started it. It begins to play the module, but no windows
  appears.
  <LI>APlayer will now first delete the remembered module list
  file when APlayer exits instead of when starting.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Unreal converter in the Module Converter
  agent, so APlayer can play the modules from the PC game Unreal
  (umx files).
  <LI><B>Fix</B> in the MikMod player, so modules that jump back
  and forward all the time, don't ends the module suddenly. Hopefully
  this method works :) Unreal uses it alot!
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the mixer. Now APlayer can play the
  &quot;Silent Service 2&quot; module. Thanks to Cedric Degea for
  sending me the module and telling about the bug.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> a memory leak in the mixer.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> the AM &amp; FM sample type and added the
  Synth type instead.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the module list that could make APlayer
  crash. Thanks to Jacob Veedfald for reporting this.
  <LI>If you added a symlink to a directory, the symlink itself
  was added instead of the files in it. Thanks to Cedric Degea
  for reporting this.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the player descriptions.
  <LI><B>Upgraded</B> the MikMod player and converter to 3.1.9.<BR>
<BR>
  Envelopes weren't loaded correctly for IMF and XM modules. In
  the average case, the first envelope point was correct, the remaining
  half points were bogus, and the other half completely random.<BR>
  Enabling the envelope (with an effect) for a sample with no associated
  envelope would cause a crash.<BR>
  Panning was ignored in GDM modules.<BR>
  Sample rate was incorrect for STM and STX modules.<BR>
  Arpeggio memory (for IT modules) was ignored.<BR>
  Tempo slide for IT modules was not processed correctly.

<H3>Version 3.6.0 Released 26. June 2000</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Added </B>the Decruncher agent, which can decrunch PowerPacker
  data files and XPK-SQSH files.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>some bugs in the APChannel class + the mixer
  when using the second syntax of the SetLoop() function. Thanks
  to Cedric for pointing this out.
  <LI>The volume slider and the main window position wasn't remembered
  if you didn't have a &quot;remembered&quot; module list file.
  <LI><B>Added </B>Amiga low-pass filter support in the player
  interface. At the moment, it's just possible to turn the filter
  on and off from a player, but the mixer doesn't use it yet.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>a bug in the ModTracker player which occured
  when a module was using the EFx effect while no samples were
  playing.
  <LI><B>Improved </B>the test routines in the ModTracker player,
  so it won't recognize a UNIC Tracker module as a Pro/NoiseTracker
  module.
  <LI>Reduced the volume in the mixer back to the original value,
  because it overpeaked some S3M modules. Too prevent sample (e.g.
  wave/mp3) playing from being too low the volume is now boosted
  a bit when they are played.
  <LI><B>Added </B>the ProWizard agent. APlayer can now play over
  80 different module formats! A big thanks to Sylvain Chipaux
  for sending me the sources.
  <LI>The save format in the sample info window wasn't saved. It
  is now!
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>some bugs in the mixer, that made some modules
  sound terrible.
  <LI>A graphics <B>bug fixed </B>in the main window.
  <LI><B>Added </B>the module format information in the module
  info window.
  <LI><B>Changed </B>the appearance when the position slider in
  the main window is in focus.
  <LI><B>Added </B>support for Unreal Tournament. Thanks to Andrew
  Kimpton for some help.
  <LI><B>Fixed </B>the sound initialization so it doesn't hang
  when you don't have any sound card.
  <LI><B>Added </B>the Sound Output and DSP agent interface. The
  API is not frozen yet, which is why the documentation is still
  lacking.
  <LI><B>Moved </B>the GetMixingFrequency() function from the APAddOnPlayer
  to the APAddOn class, so it also can be called from agents.
  <LI>If you disabled an add-on when it had a setting window open,
  APlayer crashed.
  <LI>On BeOS 5, APlayer sometimes crashed when you open the about
  window. Thanks to all the people who has reported this.
  <LI><B>Rewrote </B>the MPG123 player in C++. Also <B>fixed </B>a
  bug when playing Layer 1 in mono. It couldn't play them because
  they was interpreted as stereo :(
  <LI>The Mpeg VBR file handling is improved, so it now calculates
  the song length right.
  <LI>The &quot;Remember module list&quot; option didn't work.
  Thanks to Dennis Jakobsen for reporting this.
  <LI>If no converters are installed and you try to save a sample
  in the sample info window, it will now complain about it in nicer
  way.
  <LI>If you dragged a module to the last place in the Module List
  Editor, APlayer crashed.
  <LI><B>Changed </B>the rule for the &quot;previous module&quot;
  button a little bit. If you press the button in the first 2 seconds
  of a module, the previous module will now be loaded. If you press
  the button after that, the current playing module will start
  over again. This method should be better on modules that jump
  very quickly to another position in the beginning.
  <LI><B>Removed </B>the fade settings in the settings window,
  because they are not used at the moment.
  <LI><B>Added </B>the Sawteeth player. A big thanks to Arvid Norberg
  for creating the player. &nbsp;

<H3>Version 3.6.1 Released 4. November 2000</H3>
<UL>
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Oktalyzer player. Boy, it took some time
  to get to play the modules 100% correct. I will say that this
  player is the only one except for the original that can play
  Oktalyzer modules correct! It plays the module as the editor
  will. (The source to the player is included in the Developer
  kit :)
  <LI><B>Added</B> the PlayReleasePart() function in the APChannel
  class (needed by the Oktalyzer player).
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a little bug in the mpg123 player. It showed
  wrong information if there was some random data in the beginning
  of the file.
  <LI>If you had double buffering on and ejected a module after
  the next module in the list were loaded, but not started, APlayer
  crashed.
  <LI>APlayer can now play the Alien Breed Menu (long) correctly,
  without going to the next module too soon.
  <LI><B>Changed</B> the default sample info window size.
  <LI>If you was in a directory in one of the file panels and you
  want to open it again and the directory didn't exists anymore
  (e.g. a CD), nothing happened.
  <LI>The MikMod player does not send a message 50 times a second
  to tell the Module Info Window that the tempo has changed. It
  will only send a message when the tempo has actually changed.
  <LI><B>Added</B> the Fred player. The player can play both &quot;Final&quot;
  and &quot;Editor&quot; files.
  <LI><B>Moved</B> the MikMod icon from the converter to the player.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the MPG123 player check routine. Some mp3's
  has a huge block of zeros. The player is now able to skip these
  blocks.
  <LI><B>Rewrote</B> the ringbuffer filler thread, so the rare
  CPU eating situations are gone. Thanks to Jaakko Leikas for reporting
  this.
  <LI>If you have turned &quot;Remember list when exit&quot; on
  and the last played module doesn't exists anymore when starting,
  APlayer crashed. Thanks to Jaakko Leikas and Ove Peter for reporting
  this.
  <LI>If you have a bunch of modules in the module list, you couldn't
  select some of the last ones in the main window. Thanks to Ove
  Peter for reporting this.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> 256 bytes memory leak when playing a MultiTracker
  module.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> a memory leak in the Sawteeth player.
  <LI>The ModTracker player will now only check the first line
  in the first pattern played after BPM speed commands, instead
  of the whole patterns. This fixes a detection bug in &quot;Game
  Music Creator&quot; modules.
  <LI><B>Rewrote</B> the ProWizard agent. It's now based on the
  original Amiga program by Nicolas Franck. Some extra formats
  are still supported by merging these converter routines together
  with the new one. New formats that are now supported are: Channel
  Player v1, Channel Player v2, Channel Player v3, KRIS Tracker,
  NoiseTracker Pak, PhaPacker, ProMizer v1.0c, ProMizer v1.8a,
  ProMizer v2.0, ProMizer v4.0, Pygmy Packer, The Dark Demon, and
  Unic Tracker.
  <LI>The playing module name is now shown in the main window titlebar.
  This can be turned on and off in the settings.
  <LI><B>Removed</B> a memory leak in the Players and Agents tab
  in the settings window.
  <LI><B>Added</B> a new tab, Filetypes, in the settings window.
  <LI><B>Improved</B> the Future Composer 1.3 converter a little
  bit.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a loop bug in the MikMod player.
  <LI><B>Fixed</B> a bug in the XM effect 6 (vibrato + volume slide)
  in both the MikMod player and XM converter.
  <LI><B>Added</B> support for WinAmp extended file lists.
  <LI>When playing small mpegs, APlayer crashed on x86 machines.
